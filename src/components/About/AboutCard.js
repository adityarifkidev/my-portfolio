            Hi everyone, I am <span className="purple">Aditya Rifki Nugroho. </span><br />
            I’m currently working as a Front-End Developer and UI/UX Designer at Solusi Digital Kamu.
            <br />
           I’ve completed several projects, including building landing pages using React and designing hi-fi interfaces for the Sahabat Tani Madiun app.
            <br />
            <br />
            Apart from coding, some other activities that I love to do!
